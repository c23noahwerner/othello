I've spent ~10 hours developing the algorithm to check the positions, and getting all of that to interact correctly.
I need to implement it into the different functions, not just the one where it is currently, 
but it should be minor changes.

I've looked into programming UI in both ncurses and win32, it looks very confusing, and figured I just
needed some time in a tutorial. Overall, it shouldn't be hard to tie the logic into the UI once I get the
hang of using it. A lot of my tests were hinging on the UI display, so I could not run the specific tests,
but I did run through the functions just to make sure that they interact properly.
